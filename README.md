# Keyko SBT ZKP

A template for creating new SBTs inheriting from the Masa SBT smart contracts, using ZKP.

We use [eth-crypto](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eth-crypto) package to encrypt and decrypt the data.

The specific use case is about creating a SBT with driving license data.

For ease up testing users can mint the SBT as many times as they need

## Install dependencies and deployment

### Preparations

* Set `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY` to the deployers private key in `.env.{network}.secret`
* Set `INFURA_API_KEY` to the Infura API key in `.env`
* Set `COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY` to the CoinMarketCap API key in `.env`, if needed
* Set `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` to the Etherscan API key in `.env`, if needed
* Set the environment variables in every `.env.{network}` file. These variables are used to deploy the smart contracts to the network.

### Install dependencies

Run:
```
yarn install
```

### Build smart contracts

Run:
```
yarn build
```

### Deploy

Run:
```
yarn deploy --network {network}
```

## Contract Deployments

### Deployment addresses

You can see the deployment address of the smart contracts in the [deployments/goerli](deployments/goerli) and [deployments/mainnet](deployments/mainnet) folders. For every deployed smart contract you will find a `<smart_contract>.json` JSON file with the address in the `"address"` field.

## Zero-Knowledge Proof

Zero-knowledge proof is a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that the prover knows a value x that fulfills some constraints without revealing any information apart from the fact that he/she knows the value x.
